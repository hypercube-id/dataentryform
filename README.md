The data entry form is a Dynamic, Guided Data Entry Wizard, a multi-step form that intelligently adapts based on the user's input. This approach was chosen over a long, single-page form or a tabbed interface because it directly addresses the identified challenges.
•	Eliminates Irrelevant Fields: By using conditional logic, the wizard hides irrelevant sections, making the form feel much shorter and faster. For example, the form can begin with a question about marital status, and the answer determines whether sections on current or prior spouses are even shown.
•	Reduces Cognitive Load: The linear, step-by-step design guides the user through a logical flow, preventing them from being overwhelmed. The hundreds of fields are grouped into smaller, single-concept pages, allowing the user to focus on a small set of thematically linked fields at a time.
•	Provides Clear Context: Grouping fields into logical steps with clear titles enhances context and reduces ambiguity.
